Website Link: https://stephen823.github.io/latitude.html

## Project Intro/Objective
In this project, I aim to conclude global weather patterns concerning latitude based on statistical inferences and their interpretations through a comprehensive website. Additionally, I also seek to further support my conclusions and offer viewers opportunities to analyze patterns independently through the attachment of data visualizing graphs.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* HTML
* D3
* CSS

## Project Description
To create a well-functioning website that is also viewer-friendly, I used various website features, including drawdown menus and others. Furthermore, webpages are made to adapt to window sizes to ensure the best visual effect.
